**List out the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the code block**

I. `sortedBalances` problems:

```
const sortedBalances = useMemo(() => {
    return balances.filter((balance: WalletBalance) => {
		  const balancePriority = getPriority(balance.blockchain);
		  if (lhsPriority > -99) {
		     if (balance.amount <= 0) {
		       return true;
		     }
		  }
		  return false
		}).sort((lhs: WalletBalance, rhs: WalletBalance) => {
			const leftPriority = getPriority(lhs.blockchain);
		  const rightPriority = getPriority(rhs.blockchain);
		  if (leftPriority > rightPriority) {
		    return -1;
		  } else if (rightPriority > leftPriority) {
		    return 1;
		  }
    });
  }, [balances, prices]);
```

1. The sorting logic inside the useMemo hook doesn't accurately sort the balances array based on priority.
2. `lhsPriority` is not defined => which may cause a runtime error or unexpected behavior.
3. The `getPriority` function maps blockchain names to priority values using a switch statement. While this approach works, it can become cumbersome to maintain and update as the number of blockchains increases. Consider using a data structure like an object or a Map to store the priority values for each blockchain, making the code more scalable and easier to manage.

II. Unused variable

1. The variable `formattedBalances` is declared but not used anywhere in the code
2. The `children` variable is destructured from props

III. The variable classes is used but it is not defined anywhere in the code block

1. The variable `classes` in the className
2. types `Props`
3. `useMemo`, `useWalletBalances`, `usePrices`, `WalletRow`

IV. The `blockchain` parameter in the `getPriority` function is typed as any, which can lead to type-related bugs and decrease code maintainability.

V. There is no error handling for cases where `prices[balance.currency]` is undefined, which may lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

VI. Typescript

1. Missing declare `blockchain` for `WalletBalance` interface
2. Missing `BoxProps` interface
